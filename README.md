# darts-project
The implementation of the university homework project.

## Synopsis

This project's main goal to create a darts assistant application, where you can write the scores you threw, and it gives you the statistics and other helping functionality.
### About darts
Darts is a form of throwing game in which small missiles are thrown at a circular dartboard fixed to a wall. Though various boards and rules have been used in the past, the term "darts" usually now refers to a standardised game involving a specific board design and set of rules. As well as being a professional competitive sport, darts is a traditional pub game.

### Darts General Playing Rules

    The dartboard shall be setup or fastened so that the center of the bullseye is exactly 5 Ft 8 Inches or 1.73 meters high.
    The minimum throwing distance shall be 7 Ft 9 ¼ Inches or 2.37 meters from the face of the board, when measured horizontally.
    The toe-line or throwing line shall be clearly marked and be at least 18 inches or 45.72 centimeters long.
    Order of starting shall be determined by throwing closest to the bullseye with one dart. The winner shall throw first in the first leg, and in odd alternate legs. The loser shall throw first in the second leg and if applicable in alternate even legs thereafter.
    Any darts may be used.
    A throw consists of three darts except where a game is finished in less.
    Darts cannot be re-thrown, and only darts sticking in the board count to your score.
    On request, a player may be told what number he has scored, or what number he requires for the game by the score announcer, but not how to get it.
    If the number required for game is exceeded in the course of a throw, the throw ceases, and no account is taken of the score obtained during that throw.
    The inner bull(50) counts double of the outer bull(25).

## Motivation

This project exists because I would like to create a Darts helping program that serves every need.

## Installation

This project has been written as a maven project. If you want to install it you will need Apache Maven installed on your computer. The code is in Java, some aspects use lambda expressions, which is a new feature of the Java 8. So you have to install the latest Java version.

First you clone: 

    git clone https://github.com/nuttynb/darts-project.git

Then navigate to the root directory, where the pom.xml exists, and write the following command:

    mvn package
